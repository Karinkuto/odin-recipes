        <li><b>Ground beef or sausage</b>: Ground beef or sausage is often added to baked ziti for extra flavor and protein. However, you can also use other types of meat, such as chicken or turkey.</li>
        <li><b>Ricotta cheese</b>: Ricotta cheese adds a creamy richness to baked ziti. It is also a good source of protein and calcium.</li>
        <li><b>Other vegetables</b>: Other vegetables that can be added to baked ziti include mushrooms, onions, peppers, and spinach.</li>
        <li><b>Cheese</b>: Baked ziti is typically topped with a mixture of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. However, you can also use other types of cheese, such as provolone or Asiago.</li>
